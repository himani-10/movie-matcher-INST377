      <h2>Problem Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Choosing a movie is often difficult due to the overwhelming number of options, conflicting preferences within groups, and general indecision. Whether it is a student organization planning a screening or a group of friends deciding on a movie night, people want a quick and fair way to narrow choices down to a few high quality options everyone can agree on.

    <!-- How Movie Matcher Works -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>How Movie Matcher Works</h2>
      <p>
        Movie Matcher allows multiple users to input their genre and language preferences. Based on these combined inputs, the system recommends a small set of movies that best match the group’s shared interests. Each recommendation includes a trailer, a brief synopsis, cast information, ratings, and details on where the movie can be streamed.

    <!-- APIs Used -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>APIs Used</h2>
      <p>
        Movie Matcher uses the TMDb API to retrieve movies that match selected genres and languages. This API provides detailed movie metadata such as synopses, ratings, cast information, and trailers. To show users where each movie can be watched, the Watchmode API is used to identify available streaming platforms.
